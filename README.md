As I dove into learning React, I struggled to put all the moving pieces together, trace the flow of data through my application, and understand the larger architecture.  
And this is one of the reason I make this repo.  

01 creact-react-app and install the following dependencies


```
yarn add react-router react-router-dom redux redux-thunk express axios antd-mobile babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy
yarn add babel-plugin-import --dev
```

02 yarn run eject
