As I dived in to learning React, I struggled to put all the moving pieces together, trace the flow of data through my application, and understand the larger architecture.  
And this is one of the reason I make this repo.  

00 create a new project

The easiest way to get started with a React web project is with a tool called Create React App, a Facebook project with a ton of community help.
First install create-react-app if you donâ€™t already have it, and then make a new project with it.
```  
npx create-react-app react-app
cd react-app
yarn start
```  

01 install the following dependencies


```
yarn add react-router react-router-dom redux redux-thunk express axios antd-mobile babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy
yarn add babel-plugin-import --dev
```

02 yarn eject
